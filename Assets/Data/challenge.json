This floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas.\n - Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste we generate.\n - Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used every year to produce polyester (plastic components) .\n - Although more polyester than nylon is produced each year, nylon requires more energy to manufacture. Nylon is also three times more energy intensive than cotton to produce.\n - Plastics are mostly petrochemicals, made from petroleum, a type of oil. Engineers refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops ethylene and propylene, which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a polymer.\n - Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.).\n","reward":null,"x":1192.1,"y":1434.9,"requirement":{"fact":3},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Use a cloth bag, paper bag or lunchbox when shopping.","reward":null,"x":1542.0,"y":1046.5,"requirement":{"cloth bag/paper bag/lunchbox":1},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Not use any single plastic bag for today.","reward":null,"x":1995.0,"y":709.9,"requirement":{"plastic bag ":0},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Collect at least 3 nylon bags and put it on WECO hangers in your class.","reward":null,"x":2537.0,"y":638.0,"requirement":{"nylon bag":3,"bags put":3},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Ask at least 2 of your friends/family membesr not to use plastic bag.","reward":null,"x":2981.3,"y":886.5,"requirement":{"friend/family member":2},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Ask at least 2 of your friends/family members to download this app and see how far can they go.","reward":null,"x":2802.3,"y":1315.0,"requirement":{"friend/family member":2},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Invite at least 2 of your friends/family members to like/ share our facebook page: Weco - Environmental Activists.","reward":null,"x":3372.4,"y":1479.0,"requirement":{"friend/family member":2},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Reuse plasic bags at least 5 times.","reward":null,"x":3844.7,"y":1235.7,"requirement":{"time":5},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Collect at least 3 nylon bags outside your school area.","reward":null,"x":4395.4,"y":1074.0,"requirement":{"nylon bag":3},"id":0},{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Imagine that someone gives you a plastic bag, write down at least 5 interesting responses to deny in your journal.","reward":null,"x":4519.41,"y":635.11,"requirement":{"response":5},"id":0}],"todos":null}

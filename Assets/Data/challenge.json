This floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas.\n - Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste we generate.\n - Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used every year to produce polyester (plastic components) .\n - Although more polyester than nylon is produced each year, nylon requires more energy to manufacture. Nylon is also three times more energy intensive than cotton to produce.\n - Plastics are mostly petrochemicals, made from petroleum, a type of oil. Engineers refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops ethylene and propylene, which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a polymer.\n - Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.).\n", "x":1192.1, "y":1434.9,"requirement": {

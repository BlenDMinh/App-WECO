{"taskName":null,"taskDescription":"Read the following facts and try your best to remember the key information\n - Plastic bags take up to 1,000 years to decompose.\n - Plastic bags are hard to recycle.\n - Plastic bags reduce food safety risks.\n - The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located in the North Pacific Gyre off the coast of California and is the largest ocean garbage site in the world. This floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas.\n - Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste we generate.\n - Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used every year to produce polyester (plastic components) .\n - Although more polyester than nylon is produced each year, nylon requires more energy to manufacture. Nylon is also three times more energy intensive than cotton to produce.\n - Plastics are mostly petrochemicals, made from petroleum, a type of oil. Engineers refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops ethylene and propylene, which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a polymer.\n - Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.).\n","reward":null,"x":1192.1,"y":1434.9,"requirement":{"fact":3},"id":5}
